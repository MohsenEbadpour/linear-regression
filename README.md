# Linear Regression
The source code is an implementation for linear regression with gradient descent and normal equation from scratch with python programming language. Measure metrics are MSE, RMSE, and MAE. Also, plotting results is considered as well.

### Note:
This code was written as my Machine Learning course's assignment in the fall of 2021, so it may have some bugs to fix or be coded more optimally.
